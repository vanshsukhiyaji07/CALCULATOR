Here’s a **README** file for the **"CALCULATOR"** project:



# Simple Calculator Project

## Overview
The **Simple Calculator** is a web-based application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and provides a clean user interface for simple mathematical calculations. The calculator is responsive and works efficiently on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Features
- **Basic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Clear Screen:** Ability to clear the current input and start a new calculation.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to various screen sizes.
- **Instant Calculation:** Displays the result immediately when an operator is pressed.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** For structuring the calculator interface.
- **CSS3:** To style the calculator, making it visually appealing and responsive.
- **JavaScript:** For handling the calculator's logic, operations, and events.
